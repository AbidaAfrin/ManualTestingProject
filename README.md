Test Case: This section covers an extensive collection of test cases intended to evaluate various aspects of Aarong's functionality. Every test case includes features, type of testing, descriptions, expected results, actual results, reproducing steps, status (Pass/Fail) Bug screenshots.

Test Report: A summary of the testing procedure is given in the test reports section, together with information on completed test cases, actual results, deviations from expected behavior, and any testing-related observations. This important documentation provides information about the application's present status and points out areas needing more work.

Bug Report: This section contains extensive details of any issues detected during the testing process. Each bug report contains directions for reproducing the issue, screenshots or logs, and a severity level. This compilation helps developers understand and properly handle the issues that have been reported.

Test Metrics: Analyze the metrics and measurements gathered during the manual testing process.
